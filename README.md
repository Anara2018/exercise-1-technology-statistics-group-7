## This is a general description of a Microarray 

A microarray is a multiplex lab-on-a-chip. It is a two-dimensional array on a solid substrate (usually a glass slide or silicon thin-film cell) that assays (tests) large amounts of biological material using high-throughput screening miniaturized, multiplexed and parallel processing and detection methods.
